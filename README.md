# Distributed-Flow-Controller-Python

## Modules To-do List
1. Create friendmap python object(s) with data and methods (like mentioned in the thesis "TRUST, AUTHORITY, AND INFORMATION FLOW IN SECURE DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS")
2. Worker nodes and storage nodes (To simplify, we do not use dissemination nodes)
3. Naming scheme based on cryptography (private key: pseudorandom number generated by hashmap based on the pathname, public key: generated by non-reversible algorithms, verification: signature problem)
4. Label storage (Every clients have a copy of the updated version)
5. (Not decided yet) Principals and labeling design
6. (Optional) Instead of local server and clients, we can extend our distributed system on remote machines. SSL, message transportation, and others need to be considered
7. (Optional) Make the demo work on Docker
